Pat the chicken dry and trim any fat if preferred.

In a small bowl bowl whisk together the soy sauce, dark soy sauce, allspice, garlic and brown sugar. Set aside.

In a skillet heat the olive oil and sesame oil. Add the chicken to the skillet. Using a brush, brush about half the soy sauce mixture over all the chicken pieces.
