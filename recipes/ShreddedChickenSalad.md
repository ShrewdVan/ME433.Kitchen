This is a Chinese cold dish that is really easy to make! The ingredients are super simple too. Not all ingredients have specfic numbers as I ususally just eyeball the amount and taste myself while I make it.

### Ingredients
- 1-2 large chicken drum (use breast if you want a healthier style)
- 1-2 slice of garlic
- 20 ml of sesame oil
- chilli flakes
- soysauce
- vinegar
- sugar


### Instructions
1. Chop up garlic.
2. Put the minced garlic and chilli flakes in a small bowl.
3. Heat up the sesame oil until it smokes a little.
4. Pour hot sesame oil into garlic and chilli mix. This gives the spices a much better flavor.
5. Add soysause and vinegar to the mix. Depending on what brand you get the ratio can differ but it is usually ~3:1.
6. Add a little sugar into the sauce.
7. Boil chicken until it is cooked.
8. Shred the chicken into small slices.
9. Mix the sauce with chicken shreds.

Enjoy!
