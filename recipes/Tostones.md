- 1/2 teaspoon of black pepper
- 2 limes

### Instructions
1. Preheat a pot with cooking oil on medium to max heat on the stove.
2. Open and cut the green plantain into blocks of 2 inches approximately.
3. Mix half a cup of water with the salt, black pepper and the juice of two limes in a bowl.
4. Add the plantains pieces to the pot for about 2 minutes or until gold on the outside.
5. Take out the plantain and place them on a paper towel to dry the excess oil.
6. Smash each piece of plantain between two plates (it could be eating plates or anything flat).
7. Dip the smashed plantain in the mix of water, salt, pepper and lime.
7. Add the smashed plantain to the pot with cooking oil and fry until crispy on the outside (not burned).
