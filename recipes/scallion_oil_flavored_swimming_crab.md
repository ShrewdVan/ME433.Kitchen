## Geo's Scallion Oil Flavored Swimming Crab

This classic seafood dish from Zhoushan, where I grew up, is something my mom cooks for me every time I go back to visit her. I love serving it to my friends too, and they can't get enough of it. The recipe's very simple, but the flavor is next-level. I hope this dish inspires people to start appreciating seafood more.

### Ingredients

- 2 swimming crabs
- 2 green onions
- 5 cloves of garlic
- 2 tablespoons of soy sauce
- 2 tablespoons of oil
- 2 slices of ginger (optional, to balance the seafood flavor)

### Instructions

1. Wash the swimming crab, cut the crab into smaller pieces, and remove the gills, stomach, and other inedible parts.
2. Mince the garlic and cut the green onions into smaller pieces.
3. Place two slices of ginger on top of the crab (omit the ginger if you're a big fan of seafood) and steam the crab for about 10 - 15 minutes.
4. Drizzle soy sauce over the crab, and top it with the minced garlic and green onions.
5. Heat the oil until it starts to smoke.
6. Pour the hot oil over the crab and wait a few seconds until all the ingredients are fully mixed with the hot oil.

Hope you can enjoy!
