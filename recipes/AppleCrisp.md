Growing up this was my favorite fall dessert. It is easy to make and is great with vanilla ice cream.

### Ingredients (serves 2)
- 4 cups sliced and peeled apples (about 6 apples)
- 2/3 to 3/4 cups packed brown sugar
- 1/2 cup flour
- 1/2 cup rolled oats
- 3/4 tsp cinnamon
- 3/4 tsp nutmeg
- 1/3 cup soft butter

### Instructions
1. Preheat the oven to 375Â°
2. Put apples in a 8" greased square pan or 10"x6" bake dish
3. Blend remaining ingredients until mixture is crumbly
4. Spread mixture over apples
5. Bake for 30-35 minutes

Enjoy! :)
