My favorite Swiss comfort food is Älplermagronen — a hearty alpine dish combining pasta, potatoes, cheese, and cream, traditionally enjoyed by mountain herders.

### Ingredients
- 250g macaroni
- 200g potatoes, peeled and diced
- 1 onion, finely sliced
- 150g grated cheese (Gruyère or Appenzeller)
- 200ml cream
- 1 tablespoon butter
- Salt and pepper to taste
- Optional: applesauce on the side

### Instructions
1. Boil salted water in a large pot.
2. Add diced potatoes and cook for 5 minutes.
3. Add macaroni to the same pot and cook until both are tender, about 8 more minutes.
4. In a frying pan, melt the butter and fry the onions until golden brown.
5. Drain the macaroni and potatoes, then return them to the pot.
6. Stir in the cream and cheese until melted and creamy.
7. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
8. Serve topped with fried onions — and don’t forget a scoop of applesauce on the side!

En Guete!
