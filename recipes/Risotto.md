# Mushroom Risotto
by Sean Cheng
Cooking time ~30 mins

## Ingredients

- 1 cup Arborio rice
- 4 cups vegetable or chicken broth
- 1 cup sliced mushrooms (button or cremini)
- 1 small onion, finely chopped
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1/2 cup dry white wine
- 1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese
- 2 tablespoons butter
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- Salt and pepper to taste
- Fresh parsley for garnish

## Instructions

1. In a saucepan, heat the broth over low heat and keep it warm.
2. In a separate large skillet, heat the olive oil and butter over medium heat.
3. Add the chopped onion and minced garlic to the skillet. Cook until the onion is translucent, about 3-4 minutes.
4. Add the sliced mushrooms to the skillet and cook until they release their juices and become golden brown, about 5-6 minutes.
5. Stir in the Arborio rice and cook for 1-2 minutes until the rice is well coated with the oil and butter mixture.
6. Pour in the dry white wine and stir continuously until the wine is absorbed by the rice.
7. Begin adding the warm broth to the rice mixture, one ladleful at a time, stirring frequently. Allow each addition of broth to be absorbed before adding more.
8. Continue this process until the rice is creamy and tender, but still slightly firm to the bite, about 20-25 minutes.
9. Remove the skillet from heat and stir in the grated Parmesan cheese. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
10. Serve the creamy mushroom risotto hot, garnished with fresh parsley.
