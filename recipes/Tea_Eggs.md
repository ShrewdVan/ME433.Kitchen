I think tea eggs taste better than ordinary boiled eggs, but they are more complicated to make.

### Ingredients
- 6 eggs
- 4 cups of water
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 2 teaspoons soy sauce
- 2 teaspoons black tea leaves
- 1 star anise
- 1 cinnamon stick
- 1 teaspoon sugar
- 3 slices of fresh ginger
- 1 piece of dried orange peel 

### Instructions
1. Gently place the eggs in a pot and fill with enough water to cover the eggs. Bring to a boil, then lower the heat and simmer for about 10 minutes.
2. Remove the eggs and cool them under cold running water. With the back of a spoon, gently crack the eggshells all around, being careful not to peel them.
3. In the same pot, combine 4 cups of water, salt, soy sauce, tea leaves, star anise, cinnamon stick, sugar, ginger, and orange peel. Bring to a boil, then lower the heat to simmer.
4. Return the cracked eggs to the pot. Cover and simmer for at least 2 hours. For deeper flavors, let the eggs steep in the mixture for several hours or overnight in the refrigerator.
5. Peel the eggs before serving to reveal the beautiful marbled patterns.

Enjoy!
