## Ingredients
1oz milk (any kind)
12g roasted whole beans
water

## Tools/Equipment
Espresso machine with a steam wand
Coffee grinder

## Instructions
The process is very straight-forward, just make sure the machine has water before you start. 

To start, take about 1oz of milk and steam it while you make an espresso. An espresso is supposed to be about 1oz too, so this makes the ratio of espresso to milk about 1 to 1. The key part of the process is timing the two actions so that the milk is ready at about the same time when the espresso is ready. This will take practice, but usually if you start the espresso extraction at the time that you start steaming the milk, it will work out. As soon as the milk is steamed, pour it quickly into the cup and make a cool design if you want. Enjoy!
