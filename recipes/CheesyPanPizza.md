By Grace Jackson (Kinda)
This is the King Arthur "Crispy Cheesy Pan Pizza" Recipie. 



### Ingredients:
-> 2 cups (240g) all-purpose flour
-> 3/4 teaspoon salt 
-> 1/2 teaspoon instant yeast (or active dry yeast)
-> 3/4 cup (170g) of water, lukewarm 
-> 1 Tablespoon (13g) of olive oil for the dough 
-> 1 1/2 Tablespoon (18g) of olive oil for the pan

## Instructions

#### 24 - 72 Hours Before You Want Your Pizza: 
1. Weigh/Measure the Flour into a large mixing bowl 
 I highly reccomend using a baking scale rather than a measuring cup. 
2. Add Salt, Yeast, Water, and 1T of the olive oil 
3. Stir everything untill it is a sticky/shaggy ball of dough and cover the bowl 
4. After *Five Minutes*: Fold The Dough by reaching under it and pulling the bottom of the dough to the top. Do 4 Folds, covering roughly all four 'sides'. 
5. Repeat This Three More Times: Wait Five Minutes, Four Folds, Wait Five Minutes, For More Folds, Ect. 
6. Let it Rest, Undisturbered, Covered  for *40 Minutes* at room temperature. 
7. Put The Bowl in the Fridge 

#### 3 Hours Before You Want Your Pizza: 
1. Pour 1 1/2 T of olive oil into a cast iron (or other oven safe) pan 
2. Transfer the Dough to the pan and coat both sides in the olive oil. Use your nuckles to spread the dough to the edge of the pan. 
3. Cover and Let it Rise for *2 Hours* 
#### When it's done rising: 
4. Turn on the Oven to 450F
5. Add your topings.
