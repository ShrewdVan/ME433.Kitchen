Congrats, you want eggs in the morning and also to get rid of some stuff in your fridge! What you see below is one version of truly infinite combinations.

### Ingredients
- 2 eggs
- 1/2 white/yellow onion leftover from last night's tacos
- 2 slices of ham lunch meat
- oh cool mom bought mushrooms, why not a couple
- I think there's a serra-nope just a jalapeno
- Some amount of whatever cheese
- 1 extra egg just in case you misjudged how many add-ins you have
- salt
- pepper
- Whatever cooking oil, butter, margarine, etc...

### Instructions
1. Chop anything that's not the eggs or cheese, keep vegetables in one bowl and proteins in another
2. Brown the protein in a fair-sized glop of cooking oil in a pan until it has the color you desire
3. Remove the protein from the pan and throw the vegetables in that same pan
4. Brown the vegetables in the protein drippings, or more oil if necessary, stopping when they're cooked through
5. Beat your eggs in a separate bowl
6. Add all the protein and vegetables in
7. Add the extra egg if you overestimated the volume of add-ins
8. Add whatever amount of cheese, salt, and pepper you desire
9. Put another gloop of cooking oil in the pan, spread it around, and turn the heat to **LOW**
10. Wait a minute or so and carefully pour the egg concoction into the pan
11. If you're patient, wait until there is no jiggling in the pan, add a bit more cheese on top, and let melt. Move onto step 15
12. If you're impatient, wait until you are able to run a spatula around the entire egg thing to loosen it from the pan, then slide it onto a cutting board, jiggly side up
13. Cover the egg thing with the pan and use a towel to help flip the entire thing
14. Cook for a couple more minutes
15. Slide the whatever fritatta onto a cutting board
16. Cut into however amount of slices you want

# Enjoy!
