1. Line the bottom an dside of an 8-inch round mixing bowl with plastic wrap. 
2. Pack softened ice cream into the prepared bowl, flatten the top and cover with plastic wrap
3. Freeze until firm ~ 8hours to overnight
4. Beat egg whites, sugar, cream of tartar, and salt in a mixing bowl until stiff pearks form
5. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and place cake in the center.
