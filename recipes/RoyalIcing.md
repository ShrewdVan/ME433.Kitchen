## Kieran's Royal Icing

This is like glue, but it's kind of edible. Great for building gingerbread houses!

### Ingredients
- 3 ounces pasteurized egg whites
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 4 cups confectioners' sugar

### Instructions
1. Combine egg whites and vanilla in a large bowl. Beat until frothy.
2. Using an electric mixer, add confectioners' sugar gradually while mixing on low speed. 
3. Continue mixing until the surface of the mixture looks glossy. 
4. Increase the mixing speed as much as possible. Mix for 5-7 minutes until the mixture forms stiff, glossy peaks.
5. Use immediately (it hardens) or store in an airtight container in the refrigerator.
