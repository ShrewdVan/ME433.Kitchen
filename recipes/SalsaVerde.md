This is a very simple recipe (no claims about authenticity) I use when making green enchiladas. Acidic, but not too much spice.

### Ingredients
- 2 lbs tomatillos 
- 1 medium white onion
- 2 jalapenos (adjust as necessary based on desired heat)
- neutral oil
- 1/2 lime
- salt and pepper to taste
- 1 bunch cilantro 

### Instructions
1. Preheat oven to 425F.
2. Halve tomatillos, jalapenos, and lime, and quarter the onion. Remove seeds and ribs from jalapenos to adjust spice level.
3. Place cut ingredients in a heavy non-stick pan (e.g. cast-iron) and coat in oil.
4. Place in oven until ingredients have begun to decompose and char is visible on the onion and jalapenos, 20-30 minutes.
5. Remove lime half, squeezing into a blender. Transfer remaining contents of the pan to the blender.
6. Blend with added cilantro until smooth
7. season with salt and pepper. 


Serve with tortilla chips or use as a sauce to accompany meat.
