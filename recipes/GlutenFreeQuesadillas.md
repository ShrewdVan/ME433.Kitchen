I have Celiac so I have to eat gluten free, and this is an easy meal.

### Ingredients
- 5 oz of cut chicken
- sprinkle cheese
- 1 gluten free tortilla
    - I recommend mission gluten free tortillas because they tear the least when folded


### Instructions
1. Plug in a George Foreman until to preheat for about 5 minutes
2. Put a gluten free tortilla on plate so you can assemble the quesadilla
3. Spread chicken evenly over half the tortilla 
4. Spread sprinkle cheese over the chicken and fold over the tortilla
5. Place the quesadilla on grill and close the grill
6. Let the quesadilla cook for 5 minutes

Done!
